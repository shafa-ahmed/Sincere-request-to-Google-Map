Add a small feature which will help many lives



Kindly add a feature in Google Maps where an ambulance can update its source and destination location which could be informed to all the other 
vehicles nearby. 

So that all the vehicles who are also following the same path would get notified by an emergency alert when an ambulance is within their 500m 
radius, informing everyone else to give side to the ambulance.

I am not sure whether this would be a very successful feature or not. But if it can save even 1 life, it is worth implementing.
